    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
    <h3>For Brands and Marketers</h3>
    
    <h4>Q: How far in advance should we submit promotion details?</h4>
    <p>A: We recommend submitting promotion details at least 14 days before your planned launch date to allow time for review and any necessary revisions.</p>
    
    <h4>Q: Can we run the same promotion on multiple social media platforms?</h4>
    <p>A: Yes, but make sure to clearly identify which platforms are included and follow each platform's specific guidelines.</p>
    
    <h4>Q: What happens if our promotion violates platform policies?</h4>
    <p>A: We'll work with you to bring the promotion into compliance. In severe cases, we may remove the content and restrict future promotional activities.</p>
    
    <h3>For Creators</h3>
    
    <h4>Q: Do I need approval to run a personal giveaway?</h4>
    <p>A: No prior approval is needed for personal giveaways, but you must comply with all applicable laws and clearly state that letsflick is not the sponsor.</p>
    
    <h4>Q: Can I require followers to share personal information to enter?</h4>
    <p>A: You should limit data collection to what's necessary for prize fulfillment and comply with privacy laws. Never request sensitive information like passwords or financial data.</p>
    
    <h4>Q: What if I can't fulfill a prize I promised?</h4>
    <p>A: You're legally obligated to fulfill promised prizes. If circumstances prevent this, consult with a legal professional about your options and obligations.</p>
    
    <h3>For Participants</h3>
    
    <h4>Q: How do I know if a promotion is legitimate?</h4>
    <p>A: Look for complete official rules, clear prize descriptions, and proper sponsor identification. Be wary of promotions requiring payment or sensitive personal information.</p>
    
    <h4>Q: What should I do if I win but don't receive my prize?</h4>
    <p>A: First contact the promotion sponsor directly. If that doesn't resolve the issue, you can report it to us and may need to seek legal advice for valuable prizes.</p>
    
    <h4>Q: Can I enter the same contest multiple times?</h4>
